Description: Performs Diallel Analysis with R using Griffing's and Hayman's approaches. Four different Methods (1: Method-I (Parents + F1's + reciprocals); 2: Method-II (Parents and one set of F1's); 3: Method-III (One set of F1's and reciprocals); 4: Method-IV (One set of F1's only)) and two Models (1: Fixed Effects Model; 2: Random Effects Model) can be applied using Griffing's approach.
Depends: R (>= 4.1)
